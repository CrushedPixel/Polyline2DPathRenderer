# Polyline2DPathRenderer
*Polyline2DPathRenderer* is a [*JUCE*](https://juce.com) application showing how to draw `juce::Path`s with high performance using OpenGL.
It uses [*Polyline2D*](https://github.com/CrushedPixel/Polyline2D) to convert the path into a 2D Mesh.

To compile the application, `Polyline2D` must be in your global include directory. For more information, refer to the *Polyline2D* installation instructions.
